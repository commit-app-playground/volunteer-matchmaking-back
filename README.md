#  volunteer-matchmaking-back Backend service

# Getting Started
### Essential steps to get your backend service deployed
A helloworld example has been shipped with the template to show the bare minimum setup - a server that listens on the configured port, a dockerfile, and some kubernetes manifests.
- Webserver that listens on port 80
- Dockerfile builds and serves on port 80


# Deployment
### Things that happened behind the scenes
- The Github Org has already been configured with secrets that allow this project to deploy to the Onboarding cluster
- CI/CD will run in Github actions to deploy your application
- It will build an image and push to ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
- it will create an ingress, service, and deployment in the Kubernetes cluster using kustomize during the CI pipeline
- It will update the deployment to use the newly built docker image

# Your local environment
To set up your local environment with access to AWS and Kubernetes, just run:
```
./scripts/setup-env.sh
```
This script will open a web browser and prompt you to log in with your Commit Gmail account, and then will configure an AWS profile and a Kubernetes context.

# Creating secrets

The Playground uses a somewhat "quick and dirty" way to create secrets for your application without needing to commit them to your GitHub repository. In order to add secrets to your deployment:

1. Rename `secrets/secrets.yml.example` to `secrets.yml` (note that `secrets.yml` has been added to the `.gitignore` file, so they will not be committed to your GitHub repository).
2. Add secrets to the `stringData` section of your `secrets.yml` file as appropriate. In your deployed application, each secret key will be available as an environment variable.
3. Run `make upsert-secrets` from the root of your application which will create the secrets object on your Kubernetes cluster server.
4. Uncomment the `secretRef` and `name` lines from `kubernetes/deploy/deployment.yml`.
5. That's it! Deploy your application in order for the secrets to be picked up, and you should now be able to access them as environment variables via the defined secret keys.

# Structure
## Kubernetes
The configuration of your application in Kubernetes uses [https://kustomize.io/](kustomize) and is run by the CI pipeline, the configuration is in the [`/kubernetes`](./kubernetes/deploy/) directory.
Once the CI pipeline is finished, you can see the pod status on kubernetes in your application namespace:
```
kubectl -n volunteer-matchmaking-back get pods
```
### Configuring
You can update the configuration of the [deployment] and adjust things like increasing the number of replicas and adding new environment variables in the [kustomization] file. The [ingress] and [service] control routing traffic to your application.

## Github actions
Your repository comes with a end-to-end CI/CD pipeline, which includes the following steps:
1. Checkout
2. Unit Tests
3. Build Image
4. Upload Image to ECR
4. Deploy image to cluster
